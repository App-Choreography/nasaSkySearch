## What Did I Use?

- I used [**NASA Picture Of The Day API**](https://api.nasa.gov/)
- I generated an API key, FOR FREE, to get the images.
- I used [**React.Js**](https://reactjs.org/) to build this.
- I used [**JSX**](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) to add the Interface.
- Finally, I sprinkled [**CSS**](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) to add *style*.

## How To Use:

1. 🌟 Star the repo, so you don't lose it!
2. 🍴 Fork the repo, to have your own copy.
3. Clone the **Forked** clone to your local PC.
4. Open terminal and go to the cloned repo.
5. Copy all the files.
6. Make a new react app on your PC. Use [this](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) to help.
7. After react app is made, go to it and `npm start`.
8. Remove the `public` and `src`.
9. Paste in the copied files.
10. Go to `App.js` and find the API call, and replace `DEMOKEY` with your generated one.

# 🌟 DONE!!!
